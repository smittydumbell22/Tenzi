# TENZI Dice Game



I wantd to make a game that was like a dice game that my family played on a recent vacation. Each person had 10 dice that they had to roll simaltaneously. The goal is to roll until you have ten ones, and then roll until you have 10 twos and so forth until you have reached 10 sixes before any other players have completed all of their rounds. 

My five year old really liked the chaos of everyone rolling their dice at the same time. I wanted to make a quick game that he could play by himself.

For other projects I have used Python arcade, but for this one I wanted to try using Pygame.

# Future Work


* Keep track of the lowest number of rolls so the user can see if they can improve by completing all the rounds in a shorter number of rolls.
